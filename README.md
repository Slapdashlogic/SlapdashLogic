Install the project Gemfile: `bundle install`

The Gemfile also contains the [jekyll-admin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-admin) package, which provides a GUI for editing pages and uploading static files to the repo. After the gem is installed, run the server normally (`bundle exec jekyll serve`) and visit `http://localhost:4000/admin`.
